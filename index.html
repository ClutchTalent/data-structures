<h2>TOPIC 1: The Basics</h2>

<ol>
  <li>What is data structure?</li>
  <li>Minimum number of queues needed to implement the priority queue?</li>
  <li>What is the data structures used to perform recursion?</li>
  <li>Sorting is not possible by using which of the following methods? (Insertion, Selection, Exchange, Deletion)</li>
  <li>What is linear data structure?</li>
  <li>What is a linked list?</li>
  <li>What is stack, in the context of data structure?</li>
</ol>

<h2>TOPIC 2: Arrays and Strings</h2>

<h3>1. Zero Matrix</h3>
<p>Write an algorithm such that if an element in an MxN matrix is 0, its entire row and column are set to 0.</p>

<h3>2. Check Permutation</h3>
<p>Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other.</p>

<h2>TOPIC 3: Linked Lists</h2>

<h3>1. Palindrome</h3>
<p>Implement a function to check if a linked list is a palindrome.</p>

<h2>TOPIC 4: Stacks and Queues</h2>

<h3>1. Animal Shelter</h3>
<p>An animal shelter, which holes only dogs and cats, operates on a strictly "first in, first out" basis. People must adopt either the "oldest" (based on arrival time) of all animals at the shelter, or they can select whether they would prefer a dog or a cat (and will receive the oldest animal of that type). They cannot select which specific animal they would like. Create the data structures to maintain this system and implement operations such as enqueue, dequeueAny, dequeueDog, and dequeueCat. You may use a built-in LinkedList data structure.</p>


<h2>TOPIC 5: Binary Trees</h2>

<h3>1. Successor</h3>
<p>Write an algorithm to find the "next" node (i.e., in-order successor) of a given node in a binary search tree. You may assume that each node has a link to its parent.</p>

<h3>2. Traversal</h3>
<p>See the below image of a binary search tree, and traverse it using all available methods.</p>
