<h2>TOPIC 1: Arrays and Strings</h2>

<h3>Zero Matrix</h3>
<p>Write an algorithm such that if an element in an MxN matrix is 0, its entire row and column are set to 0.</p>

<h2>TOPIC 2: Linked Lists</h2>

<h3>Palindrome</h3>
<p>Implement a function to check if a linked list is a palindrome.</p>

<h2>TOPIC 3: Binary Trees</h2>

<h3>Successor</h3>
<p>Write an algorithm to find the "next" node (i.e., in-order successor) of a given node in a binary search tree. You may assume that each node has a link to its parent.</p>

<h2>TOPIC 4: Stacks and Queues</h2>

<h3>Animal Shelter</h3>
<p>An animal shelter, which holes only dogs and cats, operates on a strictly "first in, first out" basis. People must adopt either the "oldest" (based on arrival time) of all animals at the shelter, or they can select whether they would prefer a dog or a cat (and will receive the oldest animal of that type). They cannot select which specific animal they would like. Create the data structures to maintain this system and implement operations such as enqueue, dequeueAny, dequeueDog, and dequeueCat. You may use a built-in LinkedList data structure.</p>
