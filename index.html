<h2>BIT MANIPULATION</h2>
<!--Problems http://www.eenadupratibha.net/Engineering-Colleges/Engineering-Jobs/Documents/crackingthecodinginterview.pdf P.58-->

<h3>Problem 1</h3>
You are given two 32-bit numbers, N and M, and two bit positions, i and j. Write a
method to set all bits between i and j in N equal to M (e.g., M becomes a substring of
N located at i and starting at j).<br>
EXAMPLE:<br>
Input: N = 10000000000, M = 10101, i = 2, j = 6<br>
Output: N = 10001010100

<h2>SORTING AND SEARCHING</h2>
<!--Problems http://www.eenadupratibha.net/Engineering-Colleges/Engineering-Jobs/Documents/crackingthecodinginterview.pdf P.66-->

<h3>Problem 6</h3>
Given a sorted array of n integers that has been rotated an unknown number of
times, give an O(log n) algorithm that finds an element in the array. You may assume
that the array was originally sorted in increasing order.<br>
EXAMPLE:<br>
Input: find 5 in array (15 16 19 20 25 1 3 4 5 7 10 14)<br>

Given a sorted array of strings which is interspersed with empty strings, write a method
to find the location of a given string.<br>
Example: find “ball” in [“at”, “”, “”, “”, “ball”, “”, “”, “car”, “”, “”, “dad”, “”, “”] will return 4<br>
Example: find “ballcar” in [“at”, “”, “”, “”, “”, “ball”, “car”, “”, “”, “dad”, “”, “”] will return -1

<h3>Problem 8</h3>
<!--Problem https://cise.ufl.edu/class/cot5405su10/practiceProblems/additional/t3.pdf P.2-->
Let A = {A1,...,An} be a set of distinct coin types, where A1 < A2 <
... < An. The coin-changing problem is defined as follows. Given an
integer C, find the smallest number of coins from A, that add up to C,
given that unlimited number of coins of each type is available. Design an
efficient dynamic programming algorithm that on inputs A and C, outputs
the minimum number of coins needed to solve the coin-changing problem.

(between any two or all of them) if they start walking on the sides of the triangle?

<h2>GRAPH THEORY</h2>
<!--Problems http://www.eenadupratibha.net/Engineering-Colleges/Engineering-Jobs/Documents/crackingthecodinginterview.pdf P.69-->

<h3>Problem 11</h3>
Let's play Boggle. Given a dictionary, a method to do lookup in dictionary and a M x N board where every cell has one character. Find all possible words that can be formed by a sequence of adjacent characters.

<br>

Note that we can move to any of 8 adjacent characters, but a word should not have multiple instances of same cell.
<br><br>
Example:
<br>

Input: dictionary[] = {"GEEKS", "FOR", "QUIZ", "GO"};
<br>
       boggle[][]   =

<br>                   {{'G','I','Z'},
<br>
                       {'U','E','K'},
<br>
                       {'Q','S','E'}};
<br>
      isWord(str): returns true if str is present in dictionary
                   else false.
<br><br>
Output:  Following words of dictionary are present
<br>
         GEEKS
         QUIZ

<h2>BRAIN TEASERS</h2>
<!--Problems http://www.eenadupratibha.net/Engineering-Colleges/Engineering-Jobs/Documents/crackingthecodinginterview.pdf P.60-->

<h3>Problem 12</h3>
A bunch of men are on an island. A genie comes down and gathers everyone together
and places a magical hat on some people’s heads (i.e., at least one person has
a hat). The hat is magical: it can be seen by other people, but not by the wearer of
the hat himself. To remove the hat, those (and only those who have a hat) must dunk
themselves underwater at exactly midnight. If there are n people and c hats, how
long does it take the men to remove the hats? The men cannot tell each other (in any
way) that they have a hat.<br>

<h3>Problem 13</h3>
There is a building of 100 floors. If an egg drops from the Nth floor or above it will
break. If it’s dropped from any floor below, it will not break. You’re given 2 eggs. Find
N, while minimizing the number of drops for the worst case.

<h3>Problem 14</h3>
<!--Problem https://www.interviewcake.com/question/python/coin-->
Imagine you landed a new job as a cashier...<br>
Your quirky boss found out that you're a programmer and has a weird request about something they've been wondering for a long time.
<br>
Write a function that, given:
<br>
- an amount of money<br>
- a list of coin denominations<br>
computes the number of ways to make amount of money with coins of the available denominations.
<br>
Example: for amount=44 (44¢) and denominations=[1,2,3][1,2,3] (11¢, 22¢ and 33¢), your program would output 44—the number of ways to make 44¢ with those denominations:
<br>
1¢, 1¢, 1¢, 1¢<br>
1¢, 1¢, 2¢<br>
1¢, 3¢<br>
2¢, 2¢<br>
<!--Answer
We use a bottom-up ↴ algorithm to build up a table ways_of_doing_n_cents such that ways_of_doing_n_cents[k] is how many ways we can get to k cents using our denominations. We start with the base case that there's one way to create the amount zero, and progressively add each of our denominations.

The number of new ways we can make a higher_amount when we account for a new coin is simply ways_of_doing_n_cents[higher_amount - coin], where we know that value already includes combinations involving coin (because we went bottom-up, we know smaller values have already been calculated).

  def change_possibilities_bottom_up(amount, denominations):
    ways_of_doing_n_cents = [0] * (amount + 1)
    ways_of_doing_n_cents[0] = 1

    for coin in denominations:
        for higher_amount in xrange(coin, amount + 1):
            higher_amount_remainder = higher_amount - coin
            ways_of_doing_n_cents[higher_amount] += ways_of_doing_n_cents[higher_amount_remainder]

    return ways_of_doing_n_cents[amount]

Here's how ways_of_doing_n_cents would look in successive iterations of our function for amount=55 and denominations=[1,3,5][1,3,5].

  ===========
key:
a = higher_amount
r = higher_amount_remainder
===========

============
for coin = 1:
============
[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
 r  a

[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
    r  a

[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]
       r  a

[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]
          r  a

[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
             r  a

============
for coin = 3:
=============
[1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1]
 r        a

[1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1]
    r        a

[1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2]
       r        a

============
for coin = 5:
=============
[1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3]
 r              a


final answer: 3
